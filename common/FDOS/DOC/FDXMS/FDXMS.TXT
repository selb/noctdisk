FDXMS.SYS documentation.

FDXMS.SYS and FDXXMS.SYS is FreeDOS' replacement for HIMEM.SYS. It's
released under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, see the file
LICENSE.TXT for the full text. 

For more information about FreeDOS, go to the web site, 
<http://www.freedos.org>.


FDXMS.SYS and FDXXMS.SYS require at least a 386 CPU.

FDXMS.SYS supports up to 64MB of XMS memory. FDXXMS.SYS supports up to
4GB of XMS memory. 

FDXMST.SYS and FDXXMST.SYS is FDXMS.SYS and FDXXMS.SYS with TRACE_CODE
enabled, which can be useful for debugging (mainly FDXMS).


Supported arguments:

	NUMHANDLES=<number>
		Sets the number of XMS handles. Default is 32. Minimum
		is two (not much use of XMS without any handles!) and
		maximum is currently 1024. Each handle takes 5 bytes
		(FDXMS.SYS) or 9 bytes (FDXXMS.SYS).

	BIOS
		Makes FDXMS to always call the BIOS through INT15
		instead of using its own protected mode switching.

	PS
		Changes to the particular A20 handling necessary on
		PS/2 machines.

	GEODE
		Removes delays while changing the A20 line. Reported
		to help FDXMS to work on National Semiconductor's
		Geode GX1 processor.

	DELAY=<number>
		Number of calls to the delay routine after changing
		the A20 line. If you receive the error message "Unable
		to switch A20 address line", try setting it to a big
		value (say 4000) and see if it helps. Then fine tune
		it as you want as low a value as possible for
		speed. Default is 1. Maximum is 65535 and 0 maps to
		65536.
	
	INT15=<number>
		Amount of extended memory in kiB to leave to be
		allocated through INT15 AH=88 hooking. Remember to
		include 64 kiB reserved for HMA. Minimum is
		64 (64 kiB). Maximum is the smaller value of 0xfbbf
		kiB (~66 MB) and the size of the extended memory block
		that starts a 0x110000 minus 1.
		

Supported arguments only in FDXMST.SYS and FDXXMST.SYS:

	TRACE=<number>
		Sets the trace bitmask. A set bit indicates a trace
		printout should be shown for that function. Default is
		0.

		The bit for each function is:
			get_version (0x0)		= 0x000001
			request_hma (0x1)		= 0x000002
			release_hma (0x2)		= 0x000004
			global_enable_a20 (0x3)		= 0x000008
			global_disable_a20 (0x4)	= 0x000010
			local_enable_a20 (0x5)		= 0x000020
			local_disable_a20 (0x6)		= 0x000040
			query_a20 (0x7)			= 0x000080
			query_free_xms (0x8)		= 0x000100
			alloc_xms (0x9)			= 0x000200
			free_xms (0xa)			= 0x000400
			move_xms (0xb)			= 0x000800
			lock_xms (0xc)			= 0x001000
			unlock_xms (0xd)		= 0x002000
			get_handle_info (0xe)		= 0x004000
			realloc_xms (0xf)		= 0x008000
			request_umb (0x10)		= 0x010000
			release_umb (0x11)		= 0x020000
			realloc_umb (0x12)		= 0x040000
			query_any_free_xms (0x88)	= 0x080000
			alloc_any_xms (0x89)		= 0x100000
			get_extended_handle_info (0x8e)	= 0x200000
			realloc_any_xms (0x8f)		= 0x400000

	TRACE
		Equivalent to TRACE=0xffffffff.



<number> is positive decimal number or, if it starts with '0x', a
hexadecimal number.

FDXMS.SYS or FDXXMS.SYS you are using and the version number in your
bug report. Thank you for testing.
