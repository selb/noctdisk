 - dosfsck: Better checking of file times: ctime <= mtime <= atime

 - mkdosfs: If /etc/bootsect.dos (or similar) exists, use it as a
   template for generating boot sectors. This way, you can, e.g., make
   bootable DOS disks.

   Addendum: Don't know if that's so wise... There are really many
   variants of DOS/Windows bootcode out in the wild, and the code is
   proprietary, too. Solution: Allow boot code file to be given as
   command line option. Will also need command line options to set
   heads and secs_track for CHS and hidden for LBA: mkdosfs fills those
   with dummy values (could use /proc to get at least the first 2 values)
   normally, and some boot sectors rely on correct values!

 - dosfsck: read-only sector test (-t without -a or -r); just print
   out errors.

 - dosfsck for DOS should unlock the drive when it aborts for some
   reason. Otherwise you have to reboot (or at least close the DOS box
   in question) or manually unlock to get back to normal drive state.
