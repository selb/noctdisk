HHSTNDRD 1.0.5 Help Files Errata
================================

Rob Platt
---------

Append now documented, many of the other files are not
base disk packages, so will be included in a seperate
help file set.

Other errate are largely still outstanding at this time.

Comments / Errata for FreeDOS hhstndrd 1.0.4 of 16 May 2004

HELP should show current help file name in a status bar, and
maybe include all files for which there are "see ..." links.
[I wonder if CPIDOS could be squeezed into fewer CPI files.]

Missing man pages:
APPEND, CAL, CMOS, DEVLOAD, DOSFSCK, (DT), (DU), FINGER,
HEAD, INSIGHT (f10 to get menu), (LOADHI), LOCALIZE, LOCATE,
PG, PKGINST+UNINSTAL+RM, PTCHSIZE?, RERROR, RUNTIME, STAMP,
STRRES?, SVHEX+SVTXT (of pg), TAIL, TE, TED3, TEE, TOUCH,
TRCH, UNZIP, VGASHOT, WHICH (internal+exe), (XMSTEST), ZIP

Man pages for which I have no binaries (deprecated tools?)...:
(BOOTFIX), GRAFTABL (we do have one, but only for CP 866),
(KC), KEYMAN, LISTXDEF, NLSFUNC, PRINTER, SCANKBD, XKEYB,
PRINT (we have two different files for this: PRINTQ and PRINT)
DRIVPARM / DRIVER
[PS: I have to update my KEYB MKEYB UNDELETE KERNEL...]

Problems with index file / crosslinks (e.g.: Mark not-yet-
implemented things in index file directly. Should also mark
INTERNAL commands of FreeCOM as such in the index file!)...:
MIRROR, UNFORMAT, HIMEM vs. FDXMS, CHOICE (no batch command),
FOR (a batch command), BACKUP, RESTORE, OtherWaysToGetHelp...
FDHELP (deprecated name of FASTHELP)

Bugs in man pages:
ATTRIB /D /@ not described
CALLVER syntax not described right, and is no full SETVER
  alternative. Syntax must be CALLVER x.yy command options
CHKDSK /D value explanation missing, /R "takes long time"
  warning missing
COMP seems to be much simpler than the help page suggests
CTMOUSE /Y /L background / effect not explained well
CTTY should not be applicable to printer ports
DEBUG how-to-end-input for E and A commands not explained,
  M0, MC 387, MC2 not exaplained, XA / XD / XM / XS neither
DEFRAG should recommend using the interactive interface,
  some line wrapping problems on the man page
DELTREE dir and DELTREE dir\ have different effects - explain
DISKCOMP displays (modified/buggy?) md5sums, disk size limit
  is 32 MB, not sure if /1 works here
DISKCOPY /M /I /O /X /D /R /F /E ... not explained
EDIT help should mention builtin help system of edit and
  some known limitations (64k file size) and features (mouse)
EMM386 X= I= NOEMS not well explained. Use NOEMS to get more
  free UMBs if you need no EMS. X= can be needed e.g. for some
  network (e.g. x=e000-e7ff), I= to force UMB over other areas
EXE2BIN is to convert certain (explain) EXE to COM. The other
  convert-to-fixed-load-segment-BIN mode is not implemented.
FDAPM help could be more verbose. If APMDOS is too slow, use
  ADV:REG. Maybe mention SPINDOWN / SPINUP? Warn about VGAOFF.
  APMDOS (ADV:...) is TSR, saves most. FDAPM+QEMM = no saving?
FDISK /BMBR not explained. Otherwise hard to check the help.
  Maybe mention some recommended fdisk.ini settings?
FORMAT /Q /U is not explained. Defaults should be clever, so
  /Q and/or /U are not normally needed. /V:... is needed to
  timestamp disks. Explain unformat/mirror caveats. 720k can
  not work for 1440k media in 1440k drives. Prefer /Q /U over
  /U for harddisks. FAT32 might be incompatible. 1680k etc.!?
GRAPHICS actually only supports 3 printer types. Explain which
  keywords map to which of those 3 types. Tell people that I
  can add color{1,4,8}/thermal/graphics{,wide} if they tell me
  about still existing hardware. Same for /LCD flag - explain
GRAPH-PS GRAPHPIN GRAPH-HP explain /B (only for CGA), /R (PS
  does dither in hardware, /R is random <-> ordered dither),
  /E (reduce density to 1/2). Printouts fit both A4 and letter
  paper. Supported graphics modes are CGA, EGA and VGA ones
HIMEM line wrapping problem with man page, /TEST is for use
  from prompt. Update /X /NOABOVE16 /LOG explanation
LBACACHE size should be given in kbytes now. DRV is deprecated
  and not explained correctly. No longer a device! The INFO
  is for geeks, better use STAT now. ZERO added...
MEM /C /P not explained. Recommend /c /p and /f /p (/f also
  lists non-kernel devices, but /d is more verbose as well)
MIRROR help should tell which options are still dummy ones
MKEYB /T /L (both quite useful) not explained
MODE explains the classic MODE. Should explain the new MODE!
  Mention PARK (use BIOS, FDAPM now) and special baud rates
  (use BAUDHARD option) for people who know classic mode...
MORE has some strange /T4 option and allows wildcards. Mention
  MORESYS as an alternative for (only!) the pipe usage of MORE
MOVE help is outdated
NANSI help (tells ANSI/NANSI is NANSI): Merge to NANSI help
PAUSE can also display a message and is a batch command(?)
SET /P not explained
SHARE help and /? output could be more verbose, and the help
  could explain the purpose / WhyTo of SHARE. If NLSFUNC help
  is not removed, it should explain what NLSFUNC does and how
  to work without it. NLSFUNC is some spread-CHCP hub only...
SHSUCDX conditional-syntax not explained
SORT /N nls explanation is wrong, /N should, as far as I
  remember, just enable NLS/codepage/country based SORT ORDER
SYS /L has a typo, SYS CONFIG and settings are not explained
TICKLE explanation could be better. TICKLE reads the whole
  floppy track at once when you first read anything in a track
  - faster because the floppy has to revolve less often (but
  TICKLEHD harddisk read ahead does not seem useful...!)
TREE /V /S probably is something for PDTREE, not (FD)TREE!?
XCOPY /D /F explained different to (far too long) XCOPY /?
  output. XCOPY /I /L not explained
(Are CDRcache, ATAPICDD, EDLINE, JOIN/SUBST/SWSUBST pages ok?)

Config commands without man pages:
FILESHIGH, LASTDRIVEHIGH, INSTALLHIGH, DOSDATA=UMB, SWITCHES
(need /E in 2032-2034!), EECHO (working since 2035 only!)...
(plus secondary BUFFERS (read ahead, ZERO...8) are n/a in
FreeDOS, FCBS do not take extra RAM in FreeDOS, STACKS should
be 0,0 or 9,256 or 9,something usually, COUNTRY only accepts
one argument yet, there is no DRIVEPARM...)
Is it possible to do 12? DEVICE=... (with space after ?)?
You could add a sample config / autoexec somewhere, feel free
to use mine (may have to update them first...) :-)
