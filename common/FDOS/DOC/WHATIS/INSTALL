INSTALLING WHATIS and APROPOS
=============================

Unzip the whatis zip file to your freedos directory
(usually c:\freedos or c:\fdos). Whatever program
you use to unzip the whatis zip file, make sure that
it is set to preserve directory names.

COMPILING WHATIS FROM SOURCE
============================

NB: Apropos is just a batch file that calls WHATIS with
an option: "/A".

The WHATIS source is located in \source\whatis.

WHATIS.C was compiled with Borland Turbo C++ for DOS 3.0.
(Note that whatis.c is C code, not C++). A makefile is
provided to compile whatis.c into the most efficient code
possible.

In the makefile, check that the /I and /L parameters of the
compiler are set correctly for your setup. Then run "MAKE".
