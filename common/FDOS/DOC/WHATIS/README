WHATIS and APROPOS for FreeDOS
          Version 1.1
==============================
WHATIS and APROPOS are help programs, based on the LINUX commands by the
same names. WHATIS displays a one-line description of a command that you
specify

    WHATIS command

All command descriptions can be displayed using simply

    WHATIS

And APROPOS will list the commands relevant to a keyword that you provide

    APROPOS keyword


Why doesn't WHATIS always find commands?
========================================
WHATIS and APROPOS will display information on many FreeDOS commands,
however there are two reasons it may not be able to:

1. WHATIS bases it's information on the LSM files in the \Appinfo
directory (usually found in c:\fdos or c:\dos). Since internal commands
do not have *.LSM files, WHATIS won't be aware of them.

2. A few .LSM files do not list the program name as it would be typed on
the command line.

Default Setup
=============
Usually freedos is installed to a directory such as c:\fdos. Regardless
of the name and location of this directory, it should contain the following
subdirectories:

     \APPINFO
     \BIN
     \HELP

As long as this directory structure is maintained, and WHATIS.COM is
located in the \BIN folder, WHATIS will be able to find the .lsm files
in \APPINFO and put a WHATIS database in \HELP.

Other Setups
============
In other cases, the /S and /D WHATIS options can be used. Type WHATIS /?
for more information.

Additionally, whatis will check the environment variable HELPPATH to find the
location of the \help folder, so that the /D option doesn't have to be used
every time WHATIS is run.

There is no equivalent of HELPPATH for the /S option, but this is ok because
/S is only relevant when building the WHATIS database. The WHATIS database
is only built the first time WHATIS is run, or when the /B option is used.

Distribution
============
WHATIS and APROPOS for FreeDOS is protected under the GNU GPL.
