Version
-------

This is the documentation for chkdsk version 0.31. This version is a candidate
for version 1 and includes most of the planned features like:

- Can scan all DOS volumes that contain FAT12 or FAT16 of which the bytes per 
  sector is 512.
- Can scan image files of FAT12 or FAT16 volumes.
- Can fix all found errors, except those in the BOOT.
- Can work with long file names. It can scan them on errors and fix them.
- Can show all files in the volume together with there fragmentation factor.
- Can scan the data area for bad sectors and try to relocate clusters
  that contain bad sectors.
- Can show the files as they are being checked. 
- Can be instructed to show only a drive summary.
- Contains an internal sophisticated XMS cache for maximal scanning speed.

New in this version

Fixes by Matija Nalis for FreeDOS bugs:

1632: chkdsk gives "error accessing volume"
1633: chkdsk reports "invalid size" with monster numbers

Purpose
-------

Chkdsk is a free implementation of the MS-DOS utility with the same name. 
It scans for the most common disk errors and it can fix them.

It also shows a summary of the drive. And allows to scan the data area for 
bad sectors.

Syntax and usage
----------------

The syntax for chkdsk is as follows:

Usage:
        Chkdsk [<volume>] [/f] [/d <files>] [/r] [/s] [/v]

/f: attempt to fix any errors found.
/d: print out the indicated files and show the fragmentation factor.
/r: scan the data area and try to recover unreadable data.
/s: only show drive summary.
/v: show file name as it is being checked.

Note: if volume is ommited, the current drive is assumed.

The character for the options (the '/') actually depends on the DOS switch
character. If you have changed it to an other character than '/', you can
use that character instead (but this is not required).

Scanning and fixing errors
--------------------------

To simply scan for errors you can use the following command:

   chkdsk <volume>

eg.

   chkdsk a:

To fix all the errors found, you can enter the command:

   chkdsk <volume> /f

eg. 
   
   chkdsk a: /f

To show all the files on the volume as they are being scanned, you can add 
the /v option,

like:

   chkdsk a: /f /v

Using image files
-----------------

You can scan image files, just like you can scan a normal drive. For this you 
just enter a filename in the place of the volume. 

For example:

   chkdsk example.img /f /v

This will scan the image file for errors, try to fix the errors that are found
and report all the files in the image file as they are being scanned.


Showing the fragmentation factor
--------------------------------

Using the /d option you can instruct chkdsk to show certain files on the 
volume with there fragmentation factor.

Syntax:

   chkdsk [<volume>] [/d <wildcard>]

For example:

   chkdsk a: /d *.*

or 

   chkdsk /d *.*

or 

   chkdsk example.img /d *.*


This should give you a listing like:

c:> chkdsk defrag.img /d source\*.*

Only showing the drive summary.
-------------------------------

If you do not want to wait on a full disk scan, but just want to scan a drive
you can use the /s option.

Example:

   chkdsk example.img /s 

Scanning the data area.
-----------------------

You can scan the data area of a drive for sectors which may have become bad. 

For this you use the /r option, like:

   chkdsk a: /r

This will scan the data area of the volume in drive a: and try to recover as 
much data as possible in case some sectors may have become damaged.

Planned features.
-----------------

More fixes and the ability to choose which fix you want to apply to a certain 
file.

Support FAT32.
