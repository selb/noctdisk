Write support for XP 8.3 lowercase names?
Lowercase option for fallback and long ISO names?

Use XMS memory (for DBCS codepages)?
Have Volume Info return specified lengths?
Set creation time when creating 8.3 name (need to find entry)?
Ignore creation time altogether?

CD timezone? (Win98 doesn't, XP does.)
  No.
Drive info cache (keep relevant DPB values in heap)?
  No, it doesn't seem to make a difference (at least with extended DPB).
