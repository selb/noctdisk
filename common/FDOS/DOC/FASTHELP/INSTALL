To compile HELP:


1. first, make sure you have compiled the "Cats" library for your
   system.  Be sure to use the same memory model (this trips up a lot
   of people.)

2. Then, set the CATS macro in the makefile to the *path* of the
   CATDB.LIB library file (for example, use C:\SRC\CATS not
   C:\SRC\CATS\LIB\CATS.LIB)


3. Type:

   make -fmakefile.bc


That's it.


Edit the NLS\HELP.EN file to add new English messages.  Feel free to
provide translations of HELP.EN into other languages.  The new
translated files should be named HELP.xx (where "xx" is the
two-letter country abbreviation - for example, Germany would use
HELP.DE and France would use HELP.FR)
