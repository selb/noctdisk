This is the readme for the FreeDOS HELP program

HELP will display a text file help topic.  It uses these environment
variables:

   PAGER: the program that will display the help files
   HELPPATH: the location of your help files
   LANG: the preferred language to display the help files

If PAGER is not present, "MORE" is assumed.

If HELPPATH is not present, HELP uses the path based on the program
name, and if not found then "C:\FDOS\HELP" is assumed.

If LANG is not present, "EN" is assumed.


This program has international support using the "Cats" library
(catopen/catgets implementation for DOS).  "Cats" is distributed under
the terms of the GNU LGPL.  You can download "Cats" from
http://www.freedos.org/jhall/cats/

HELP is distributed under the GNU GPL.  See the file COPYING for
details.
