This is the release history for HELP:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.5: This is really a version of DOS FASTHELP, so I've changed
 the program name to represent that.  Also, updated help.de by Achim
 Sondermann, and added help.hu by Nagy Daniel.

Version 3.4a: Added help.de, contributed by achim_sondermann

Version 3.4: Better handles a non-existent HELPPATH variable.  Rather
 than immediately using a default path, we look it up based on the path
 to the FDHELP program.

Version 3.3: Internationalization LANG support by Abrahan Sanjuas
 Fontan.  You can now SET LANG=xx to display help files in a preferred
 language.  NOTE THAT THIS NOW CHANGES HOW 'HELP' WILL LOOK FOR HELP
 FILES.  All your help files will now need to have an extension that
 indicates the language.  This is not the same as language catalogs.

Version 3.2: added help.lv, by Neons <neons_lv@inbox.lv>

Version 3.1: added help.ru, contributed by Ilya Vasilyev <arvi@online.ru>

Version 3: added international support using "Cats" library

Version 2: re-write to be cleaner code

Version 1: First version, released as part of the FreeDOS Utilities
 package in 1994.
