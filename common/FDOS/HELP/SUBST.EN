       _s_u_b_s_t  is  designed to manipulate the CDS ( D S by a drive
       letter.

       _s_u_b_s_t is part of the _s_w_s_u_b_s_t package. It can  be  created,
       if  it  does  not already exist, by copying the executable
       swsubst.exe to subst.exe

       /?     Displays a little help screen.

       /d     Causes _s_u_b_s_t to break off the relation between  the
              drive  letter dr and the substituted path. If dr is
              JOIN'ed and not SUBST'ed, the relation is been bro-
              ken off, too.

       dr1: dr2:path
              Causes  _s_u_b_s_t  to  substitute the path on drive dr2
              with the drive letter dr1 dr1 is  already  SUBST'ed
              or JOIN'ed, this relation will be broken off.  path
              need not neither exist nor fully qualified. It will
              be created as well as the full path relative to the
              current working directory on drive dr2

       without any parameter
              This dumps a list onto the  screen  containing  all
              SUBST'ed  drives  in  the form: X: => Y:PATH; where
              Y:PATH is the fully-qualified path and by  X:  sub-
              stituted  path.  If  there is no SUBST'ed drive, no
              output occurs.
