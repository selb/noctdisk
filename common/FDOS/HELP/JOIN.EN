       _j_o_i_n  has been designed to manipulate the CDS ( D S direc-
       tory of another drive.

       _j_o_i_n is part of the _s_w_s_u_b_s_t package. It can be created, if
       it  does  not  already  exist,  by  copying the executable
       swsubst.exe to join.exe

       /?     Displays a little help screen.

       /d     Causes _j_o_i_n to break off the relation  between  the
              directory  and  the JOIN'ed drive dr dr is SUBST'ed
              and not JOIN'ed, the relation is been  broken  off,
              too.

       dr1: dr2:path
              Causes  _j_o_i_n  to  join drive dr1 into path on drive
              dr2 dr1 is already SUBST'ed or JOIN'ed, this  rela-
              tion  will  be  broken  off.  path need not neither
              exist nor fully qualified. It will  be  created  as
              well as the full path relative to the current work-
              ing directory on drive dr2

       without any parameter
              This dumps a list onto the  screen  containing  all
              JOIN'ed  drives  in  the  form: X: => Y:PATH; where
              Y:PATH is the fully-qualified path and  X:  JOIN'ed
              in  drive.  If there is no JOIN'ed drive, no output
              occurs.
